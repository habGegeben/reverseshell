## reverseshell
reverse shell for *nix

DON'T USE THIS FOR BAD. K? K.

This probably won't work on macOS or most OS's, as I wrote it a long while ago. If you want me to update it, bother me about it and I'll fix it.

I wrote this one day when trying to drop a quick shell on a coworker who got up to go strike out with yet another female coworker. Rejection was always swift, so I only had a few seconds to act.

# Make the script executable

`chmod +x reverseshell.sh`

When you see his confidence build up (you'll know by the smirk in his face), go ahead and get a port ready:

# Run the reverse shell script

`./reverseshell.sh`

The default is port 3344. Change it if you want something different.

# Hustle your fatass over to his machine

Copy and paste the output and hit enter. This will open the shell and close the terminal window for you. On newer mac's this won't work and you'll hate me shortly after.

# Mess with your coworker

At this point it's up to you. Maybe a good IT Security team will catch you, though, as what you're doing is most definitely against corporate policy. Enjoy the trip to HR and cross your fingers for a severance package.
